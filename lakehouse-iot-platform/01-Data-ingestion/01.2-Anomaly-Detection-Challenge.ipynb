    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Time:** 30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to add data quality checks with `CONSTRAINT` and `EXPECT`\n",
    "- Different violation strategies: `DROP ROW`, `FAIL`, `QUARANTINE`\n",
    "- Why data quality matters in production pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Your Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations team reports that sometimes **bad sensor data** causes false alerts. Your task: Add quality checks to prevent invalid data from flowing through the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Task Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the pipeline notebook: `01-Data-ingestion/01.1-SDP-Wind-Turbine-SQL.ipynb`\n",
    "2. Find the `sensor_hourly` table definition\n",
    "3. Add **3-5 CONSTRAINT statements** to validate the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Rules to Implement\n",
    "\n",
    "Add constraints that check for:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Power values are realistic**\n",
    "- Power should be between 0 and 5000 kW\n",
    "- Action: DROP ROW if violated (bad sensor reading)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Vibration is within safe limits**\n",
    "- Vibration should be between 0 and 2\n",
    "- Action: FAIL if violated (pipeline should stop - critical issue!)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **No null turbine IDs**\n",
    "- Turbine ID must not be null\n",
    "- Action: DROP ROW if violated\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Temperature is reasonable**\n",
    "- Temperature should be between -30 and 50 degrees\n",
    "- Action: DROP ROW if violated\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Your choice!** Think of another quality rule\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Code Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- In 01.1-SDP-Wind-Turbine-SQL.ipynb, find this table:\n",
    "CREATE OR REFRESH LIVE TABLE sensor_hourly\n",
    "-- Add constraints like this AFTER the table name:\n",
    "(\n",
    "  CONSTRAINT valid_power EXPECT (avg_power > 0 AND avg_power < 5000) ON VIOLATION DROP ROW,\n",
    "  CONSTRAINT valid_vibration EXPECT (avg_vibration BETWEEN 0 AND 2) ON VIOLATION FAIL,\n",
    "  -- Add more constraints here...\n",
    ")\n",
    "AS SELECT ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ON VIOLATION Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DROP ROW:** Silently remove bad rows (for occasional bad readings)\n",
    "- **FAIL:** Stop the pipeline (for critical data issues)\n",
    "- **QUARANTINE:** Move to separate table for investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Validation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After adding constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Save the pipeline notebook**\n",
    "2. **Update your pipeline** (it will reprocess with new rules)\n",
    "3. **Check pipeline metrics:**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- Run this to see quality metrics:\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM event_log(TABLE(LIVE.sensor_hourly))\n",
    "   WHERE details:flow_progress.data_quality.expectations IS NOT NULL\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. **Verify:** Did any rows get dropped? Pipeline should show \"expectations met\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Added at least 3 CONSTRAINT statements  \n",
    "✅ Used different ON VIOLATION strategies  \n",
    "✅ Pipeline runs successfully  \n",
    "✅ Can see quality metrics in pipeline logs  \n",
